        <p>
          MathJax can help you with the conversion of math documents from legacy
          sources and print content as well as with the generation of novel
          content that is online ready and fully accessible for readers with
          special needs. The MathJax team is available to consult on putting the

        <p>
          MathJax can also be employed in server-side workflows to prepare
          content that can be viewed offline or generate documents that are
          compatible with modern ePub readers. Accessibility can be ensured by
          including alternative textual descriptions or more fine-grained speech
          annotations and Braille.
