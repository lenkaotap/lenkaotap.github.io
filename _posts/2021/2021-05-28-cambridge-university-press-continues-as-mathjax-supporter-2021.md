[Cambridge University Press](http://cambridge.org) continues to support the MathJax project as a MathJax Supporter.

With its first publication dating back to 1584, Cambridge University Press (CUP) is the oldest publishing house in the world. As part of the University of Cambridge. CUP follows the University's mission to disseminate knowledge in the pursuit of education, learning and research at the highest international levels of excellence. Today, CUP publishes 50,000 titles by authors from over 100 countries with platforms such as [Cambridge Core](https://www.cambridge.org/core) leveraging MathJax to deliver high-quality, accessible mathematics in over 300 peer-reviewed journals.

“Cambridge University Press is pleased to work with MathJax to ensure the optimal presentation of mathematics content in the research we disseminate online. We’re committed to our publishing partnership with the math and science community and delighted to be a MathJax sponsor,” says Roger Astley, Executive Publisher, Mathematical Sciences.

“We value the continued backing that Cambridge University Press offers MathJax, and are pleased to contribute to their web-based mathematical offerings”, comments Davide P. Cervone, MathJax lead developer. "As a MathJax Supporter, CUP makes an important contribution to keeping MathJax the reliable, flexible, and open technology it is today.”

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with CUP, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
