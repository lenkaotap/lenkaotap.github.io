[Elsevier](http://www.elsevier.com) continues to support the MathJax project as a MathJax Sponsor.

Elsevier is a world-leading provider of information solutions for science, health, and technology professionals. Elsevier provides web-based, digital solutions — among them ScienceDirect, Scopus, Elsevier Research Intelligence, and ClinicalKey — and publishes over 2,600 journals, including The Lancet and Cell, and more than 33,000 book titles, including a number of iconic reference works.  Elsevier is actively advancing discipline-specific content, format, and tools to the author and user needs and workflow.

“Elsevier consistently and proactively endeavours to make our products fully accessible to all our readers. MathJax is a crucial component of our ability to consistently render math equations across all fulltext journals and books on ScienceDirect in an accessible manner, and a feature we know to be greatly valued by our users. We are therefore delighted to continue our support of the MathJax project,” commented Rose L'Huillier, SVP Product Management Reading at Elsevier

"Elsevier's long-term support and feedback has been invaluable to MathJax during our development efforts.  Their technical expertise and large corpus of mathematical texts are a perfect match for our needs", said Davide P. Cervone, MathJax lead developer. "Thanks to Elsevier, we can continue to enhance MathJax, and remain a key technology for math and science on the web."

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with Elsevier and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
