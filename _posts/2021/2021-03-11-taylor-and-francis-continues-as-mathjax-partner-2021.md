Taylor &amp; Francis, a division of [Informa plc](http://www.informa.com/), is a leading international academic publisher with more than 2,700 journals, over 7,000 new books each year, and a books backlist in excess of 140,000 specialist titles. Access to all journals from Taylor &amp; Francis, Routledge and Psychology Press is provided by T&amp;F's state-of-the art platform [Taylor &amp; Francis Online](http://tandfonline.com) where MathJax provides beautiful, accessible mathematics in publications such as the journals of the [American Statistical Association](http://amstat.tandfonline.com/) and the [Mathematical Association of America](https://maa.tandfonline.com/).

Paul Naish, Global Head of Portfolio for Mathematics &amp; Statistics at Taylor &amp; Francis, noted “Taylor &amp; Francis are dedicated supporters of MathJax since 2014. We are fans for a number of reasons, not least is the accessibility that MathJax provides for those using assistive technology, but also its simple and effective readability of equations in any browser.”

“We are indebted to sponsors like Taylor &amp; Francis for their dedication to making mathematics available and accessible on the web,” comments Davide Cervone, MathJax lead developer and project manager. “The continuing support from Taylor &amp; Francis helps us to improve MathJax, develop new features, and maintain our high standards for on-line mathematical presentation.”

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with Taylor &amp; Francis, and welcome their ongoing participation in the MathJax project.
