[EBSCO Information Services](http://www.ebsco.com) (EBSCO) continues to support MathJax as a MathJax Supporter.

EBSCO is the provider of online research content and search technologies serving academic, school and public libraries; healthcare and medical institutions; corporations; and government agencies around the world.  From research, acquisition management, subscription services and discovery to clinical decision support and patient care, learning, and research and  development, EBSCO provides institutions with access to content and resources to serve the information and workflow needs of their users and organizations. Its participation in the sponsorship program is just one way that EBSCO is involved with MathJax. EBSCO also uses MathJax to ensure that the mathematical equations are optimally displayed when they appear in its research databases.

EBSCO Information Services Vice President of Database Partnerships, Ryan Bernier, said, “MathJax improves accessibility, readability and interpretation of equations on both desktop and mobile devices. As a provider of STEM e-journals and databases including MathSciNet, EBSCO is proud to support the development and enhancement of MathJax.”

MathJax's lead developer responds: "We are pleased to partner with EBSCO to help bring their quality research content on line.  EBSCO's ongoing contributions to MathJax allow us to develop new features, and help maintain MathJax as a key component for accessible mathematics on the web."

The MathJax team looks forward to continued collaboration with EBSCO and welcomes its support for the MathJax project.
