The [London Mathematical Society](http://lms.ac.uk/) continues to support MathJax as a MathJax Supporter.

The London Mathematical Society (LMS) is the major UK learned society for mathematics with a nationwide and international membership. The LMS offers a rich publishing program, provides a diverse grant program, and organizes scientific meetings and lectures. Beyond that, the LMS  contributes to public debate on matters affecting mathematics and mathematics education.

“The London Mathematical Society ensures that MathJax is used for rendering browser-friendly mathematics in its journals”, said Caroline Wallace, Executive Secretary, LMS. “Provision of full-text HTML along with the PDF is now the publishing standard. MathJax provides a particularly simple means of rendering mathematics in HTML because of its ability to display embedded LaTeX equations. The LMS is proud to support the continued development and enhancement of MathJax to ensure that it remains up to date, versatile, and continues to offer fluid rendering of mathematical web pages.”

“We value the continuing support of the London Mathematical Society as one of our key sponsors”, said Davide Cervone, MathJax lead developer and project manager.  “Their support helps us to maintain and improve MathJax, so that MathJax remains reliable, flexible, and open source into the future."

We look forward to continuing our collaboration with the LMS, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
