[Springer Nature](http://www.springernature.com/) continues to support the MathJax project as a MathJax Supporter.  Springer Nature describes themselves as follows:

"Springer Nature advances discovery by providing the best possible service to the whole research community. We make sure all the research we publish is significant, robust and stands up to objective scrutiny and reaches all relevant audiences in the best possible format so it can be discovered, accessed, used, re-used and shared. We support librarians with innovation in technology and data; and provide quality publishing support to societies. Springer Nature is home to trusted brands including Springer, Nature Research, BMC, Palgrave Macmillan and Scientific American. For more information please visit [springernature.com](https://www.springernature.com) and [@SpringerNature](https://www.facebook.com/SpringerNature/)."

"The quality of our online publications relies on accurate display of mathematical content", they continue. "MathJax is critical to achieving this. We are pleased to continue our sponsorship of MathJax and engage with its team as well as a community dedicated to the advancement of mathematics on the web."

MathJax's lead developer responds: "We value the contribution that Springer Nature makes to science, and their support of the MathJax project.  Springer's ongoing donations to MathJax allow us to develop new features, and help maintain MathJax as a key component for accessible mathematics on the web."


The MathJax team looks forward to continuing the collaboration with Springer and welcomes their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
